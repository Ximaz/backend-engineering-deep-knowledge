# Backend Engineering Deep Knowledge

This repository contains summaries on what I learnt to master backend
engineering.

Even if it looks small, it will keep evolving as I learn more in depth
some concepts I already touched, but not had the opporunity to master.

## Databases

The [./databases](./databases/) documents describe how databases work, how to
use them, choosing wisely depending on needs, and so on.
